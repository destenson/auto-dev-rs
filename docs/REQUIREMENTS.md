## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Design the system in a modular way to allow easy addition and removal of features.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle projects of varying sizes and complexities.
- **User-Centric**: Focus on providing a user-friendly experience for developers of all skill levels.
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency to minimize delays in the development process.
- **Low Resource Usage**: Ensure the system can run on machines with limited resources without significant performance degradation.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and code.
- **Low-cost**: Aim to minimize costs associated with using the platform, including hosting and third-party service fees.

## Design Decisions

- **Language Choice**: Use Rust for its performance, safety, and concurrency features.
- **Open Source**: Make the project open-source to encourage community contributions and transparency.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Implement a plugin system to allow users to extend functionality as needed.
- **Tool Integration**: Prioritize integration with widely-used tools and platforms to maximize utility.
- **Configuration Management**: Use a simple and flexible configuration system to allow users to customize their experience.
- **Testing**: Prioritize testing and quality assurance to ensure reliability and stability.
