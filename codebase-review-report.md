# Codebase Review Report - Auto Dev RS

## Executive Summary

The auto-dev-rs project is in its initial state with only a basic "Hello, world!" Rust application. The README describes an ambitious vision for a comprehensive development automation platform with 13 major features, but none have been implemented yet. **Primary recommendation: Create a PRP (Project Requirements and Planning) document to define the MVP scope and begin implementing the core architecture with the most fundamental feature first.**

## Implementation Status

### Working
- **Basic Rust Project Structure** - Cargo.toml and main.rs are properly configured
- **Build System** - Project builds and runs successfully (`cargo build` and `cargo run` work)
- **Project Vision** - Clear feature list defined in README.md

### Broken/Incomplete
- **All Features** - None of the 13 features listed in README are implemented
- **Documentation** - No TODO.md, BUGS.md, or technical documentation exists
- **Testing** - No tests written (0 tests found)
- **Examples** - No example code or usage demonstrations

### Missing
- **Core Architecture** - No modules, traits, or architectural foundation
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - No GitHub Actions or deployment configuration
- **Plugin System** - No plugin infrastructure despite being a key feature
- **PRPs Directory** - No planning documents or feature specifications
- **Dependencies** - No external dependencies defined (Cargo.toml is empty)

## Code Quality

- **Test Results**: 0/0 passing (No tests exist)
- **TODO Count**: 1 occurrence in README.md
- **Examples**: 0/0 working (No examples exist)
- **Code Complexity**: Minimal - only contains a simple main function
- **Error Handling**: N/A - No error-prone code exists yet

## Recommendation

### Next Action: **Create Architectural PRP and Implement Core Module System**

**Justification**:
- **Current capability**: Basic Rust project that compiles but has no functionality
- **Gap**: No architectural foundation to build the 13 planned features upon
- **Impact**: Establishing the core architecture will enable parallel development of multiple features and create a sustainable codebase structure

### Immediate Action Items

1. **Create PRPs/001-mvp-architecture.md** defining:
   - Core module structure (CLI, plugin system, project management)
   - Trait definitions for extensibility
   - Error handling strategy
   - Configuration management approach

2. **Implement Core Foundation**:
   - CLI argument parsing with clap
   - Configuration system with serde
   - Plugin trait and loading mechanism
   - Basic project structure detection

3. **Select MVP Feature** - Choose one feature from the list to implement first (recommend: Code Generation as it's foundational)

### 90-Day Roadmap

**Week 1-2: Architecture & Foundation**
- Create architectural PRP document
- Implement CLI structure with subcommands
- Add configuration management
- Set up error handling patterns
→ **Outcome**: Extensible CLI application with plugin support

**Week 3-4: First Feature - Code Generation**
- Design template system
- Implement boilerplate generators for 2-3 languages
- Add customization options
- Write comprehensive tests
→ **Outcome**: Working code generation for Rust, Python, and JavaScript

**Week 5-8: Project Management & Version Control**
- Implement task tracking system
- Add Git integration
- Create project initialization workflow
- Build project configuration management
→ **Outcome**: Basic project management capabilities with Git integration

**Week 9-12: Testing & Documentation**
- Implement testing framework integration
- Add documentation generation
- Create example projects
- Write user documentation
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
→ **Outcome**: Production-ready MVP with 3-4 core features

## Technical Debt Priorities

1. **No Architecture**: [Critical Impact] - [High Effort]
   - Must be addressed immediately before any features can be built

2. **No Tests**: [High Impact] - [Medium Effort]
   - Should be implemented alongside each new feature

3. **No Documentation**: [Medium Impact] - [Low Effort]
   - Create as features are developed

4. **No CI/CD**: [Medium Impact] - [Low Effort]
   - Set up GitHub Actions after first feature is complete

5. **No Error Handling Strategy**: [High Impact] - [Low Effort]
   - Define patterns in architectural PRP

## Implementation Decisions to Document

As this is a greenfield project, key decisions to make and document:

1. **Architectural Decisions**
   - Plugin architecture (dynamic loading vs static compilation)
   - Async runtime choice (tokio vs async-std)
   - CLI framework (clap vs structopt)

2. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Documentation requirements
   - Code review process

3. **Design Patterns**
   - Command pattern for CLI operations
   - Strategy pattern for language-specific generators
   - Observer pattern for project monitoring

4. **Technical Solutions**
   - Configuration format (TOML, YAML, or JSON)
   - Template engine for code generation
   - Storage strategy for project metadata

## Conclusion

The auto-dev-rs project has a clear vision but requires immediate architectural planning and implementation to begin realizing its potential. The recommended approach focuses on building a solid foundation that can support the ambitious feature set outlined in the README. Starting with core architecture and a single MVP feature will provide momentum and establish patterns for future development.
