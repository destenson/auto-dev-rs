# PRP: Self-Testing Framework

## Overview
Create a comprehensive testing framework that validates auto-dev-rs's self-modifications before they are applied, ensuring that self-development doesn't break the system.

## Context and Background
When auto-dev-rs modifies itself, it needs to rigorously test the changes before committing them. This framework provides multi-level testing specifically designed for validating self-modifications.

### Research References
- Property-based testing: https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck
- Mutation testing: https://github.com/llogiq/mutagen
- Regression testing: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html
- Contract testing: https://docs.pact.io/

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Test self-generated code before integration
2. Validate module interfaces remain compatible
3. Ensure core functionality preserved
4. Test performance characteristics
5. Verify safety constraints maintained

### Technical Constraints
- Must run in isolated environment
- Cannot affect production system
- Should complete within reasonable time
- Must catch breaking changes
- Should support incremental testing

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Testing Strategy
**Chosen**: Layered testing with staged validation
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full system test only: Too slow
- Unit tests only: Misses integration issues
- Random testing: Not comprehensive
**Rationale**: Layers provide fast feedback with comprehensive coverage

### Decision: Test Environment
**Chosen**: Isolated sandbox with state snapshots
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Docker containers: Platform dependency
- Virtual machines: Too heavy
- In-place testing: Too dangerous
**Rationale**: Sandboxing provides isolation without external dependencies

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Structure
Create testing framework in auto-dev-core/src/self_test/
- mod.rs - Testing framework interface
- test_runner.rs - Test orchestration
- sandbox_env.rs - Isolated test environment
- compatibility.rs - Interface compatibility tests
- regression.rs - Regression test suite
- performance.rs - Performance benchmarks
- safety.rs - Safety constraint validation

### Key Components
1. **SelfTestRunner** - Main test orchestrator
2. **TestSandbox** - Isolated environment
3. **CompatibilityChecker** - API compatibility
4. **RegressionSuite** - Core functionality tests
5. **SafetyValidator** - Safety constraint checks

### Implementation Tasks (in order)
1. Create test sandbox environment
2. Build test runner with phases
3. Implement compatibility checking
4. Create regression test suite
5. Add performance benchmarking
6. Build safety validation tests
7. Implement test result analysis
8. Add test coverage tracking
9. Create test report generation
10. Build continuous test mode

## Test Levels
1. **Syntax** - Code compiles
2. **Unit** - Individual functions work
3. **Integration** - Modules work together
4. **Compatibility** - Interfaces unchanged
5. **Regression** - Existing features work
6. **Performance** - No degradation
7. **Safety** - Constraints maintained
8. **End-to-end** - Full system works

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Run self-test suite
cargo run -- self-test all

# Test specific modification
cargo run -- self-test module synthesis

# Compatibility check
cargo run -- self-test compatibility

# Performance regression
cargo run -- self-test performance --baseline
```

## Success Criteria
- Catches 95% of breaking changes
- Runs full suite in <5 minutes
- No false positives
- Provides actionable failure messages
- Supports parallel test execution

## Known Patterns and Conventions
- Use snapshot testing for outputs
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Reuse existing test utilities
- Match cargo test output format

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't test in production environment
- Remember to test error paths
- Avoid flaky time-dependent tests
- Don't skip integration tests
- Consider test interdependencies

## Dependencies Required
- Already available: standard test framework
- Consider: insta for snapshot testing
- Optional: criterion for benchmarking

## Test Categories for Self-Modifications

### Critical Tests (Must Pass)
- Core CLI functionality
- Module loading system
- Safety boundaries
- State preservation
- Rollback mechanism

### Important Tests (Should Pass)
- Performance benchmarks
- API compatibility
- Documentation generation
- Error handling
- Logging functionality

### Nice-to-Have Tests
- Code style compliance
- Documentation coverage
- Example validity
- Deprecation warnings

## Confidence Score: 8/10
Testing framework builds on Rust's strong testing infrastructure. Main challenge is ensuring comprehensive coverage of self-modification scenarios.
