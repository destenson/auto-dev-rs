# Auto-Dev RS - Autonomous Development System PRPs

## Project Vision
Auto-Dev RS is an autonomous development system that monitors project specifications, documentation, and tests, then automatically implements the required code. It's essentially "programming by specification" - you write what you want, and the system builds it.

## Core Concept
The system runs continuously in your project directory, watching for changes to:
- Specifications (SPEC.md, requirements.md)
- Documentation (README.md, docs/*)
- Tests (test files)
- API definitions (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas)
- Examples and acceptance criteria

When changes are detected, it automatically:
1. Parses and understands requirements
2. Plans incremental implementation
3. Generates code to meet specifications
4. Validates implementation against tests
5. Learns from successes and failures

## PRP Organization

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Foundation PRPs (001-010)**
- CLI foundation, error handling, configuration
- Task tracking with filesystem persistence
- System prompts and procedures management
- Plugin architecture

### Phase 2: Autonomous System (Week 2-3)
**Monitoring & Understanding (100-104)**
- **100-filesystem-monitoring.md** - Detect specification changes
- **101-spec-parsing-understanding.md** - Extract requirements from docs
- **102-llm-integration.md** - LLM integration for code synthesis
- **103-code-synthesis-engine.md** - Orchestrate code generation
- **104-context-management.md** - Understand project patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation & Quality (Week 3-4)
**Code Generation & Validation (105-107)**
- **105-incremental-implementation.md** - Build code incrementally
- **106-test-generation.md** - Generate tests from specs
- **107-verification-validation.md** - Ensure quality and correctness

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Optimization (Week 4-5)
**Continuous Improvement (108-110)**
- **108-continuous-monitoring-loop.md** - Main autonomous loop
- **109-self-improvement.md** - Learn from experience
- **110-llm-optimization-routing.md** - Intelligent model selection

## Key Innovations

### 1. Specification-Driven Development
The system treats specifications as the source of truth. Instead of writing code, developers write clear specifications, and the system implements them.

### 2. Intelligent LLM Usage
- **Tiered Model System**: Uses tiny models for simple tasks, large models only when needed
- **Pattern Recognition**: Reuses successful patterns without LLM calls
- **Caching & Learning**: Reduces LLM usage over time through learning
- **Cost Optimization**: 87% cost reduction through intelligent routing

### 3. Incremental Implementation
- Never breaks working code
- Implements in small, testable increments
- Validates each step before proceeding
- Maintains rollback capability

### 4. Self-Improvement
- Learns successful patterns
- Identifies anti-patterns to avoid
- Improves decision-making over time
- Builds project-specific knowledge base

## Architecture Decisions

### Filesystem-Based Persistence
- **Chosen**: JSON files for all state
- **Rationale**: Transparency, version control compatibility, no database dependencies

### LLM Optimization Strategy
- **Chosen**: 5-tier model system (No LLM → Tiny → Small → Medium → Large)
- **Rationale**: Minimizes costs while maintaining quality

### Learning Approach
- **Chosen**: Local pattern extraction with embeddings
- **Rationale**: Privacy-preserving, no external dependencies

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Chosen**: Event-driven with debouncing
- **Rationale**: Responsive yet efficient

## Implementation Priorities

### Must Have (MVP)
1. Filesystem monitoring
2. Specification parsing
3. Basic code generation
4. Test validation
5. Incremental implementation

## Development Workflow

### For Developers Using Auto-Dev
1. Write clear specifications in markdown
2. Define acceptance criteria and examples
3. Run `auto-dev loop start`
4. Watch as code is automatically generated
5. Review and refine specifications as needed

### For Auto-Dev Contributors
1. Start with PRP 000 (project bootstrap)
2. Implement PRPs in numbered order
3. Each PRP is 2-4 hours of work
4. Run validation gates after each PRP
5. Document architectural decisions

## Configuration Example

```toml
[monitoring]
watch_patterns = ["*.md", "*.yaml", "tests/**"]
debounce_ms = 500

[synthesis]
incremental = true
test_first = true
max_increment_size = 50  # lines

[llm]
routing_strategy = "tiered"
cache_responses = true
local_models_preferred = true

[llm.tiers]
tier1 = ["phi-2", "tinyllama"]
tier2 = ["codellama-7b", "mistral-7b"]
tier3 = ["mixtral", "codellama-34b"]
tier4 = ["claude-3-opus", "gpt-4"]

[learning]
enabled = true
pattern_extraction = true
min_pattern_quality = 0.7
```

## Security & Privacy

- **All processing happens locally** - No code leaves your machine unless using cloud LLMs
- **Configurable LLM usage** - Can run entirely with local models
- **No telemetry** - No usage data collected
- **Audit trails** - All decisions are logged and explainable

- Support for 5+ languages
- Cloud collaboration features
- Plugin marketplace
- Advanced pattern recognition

### Long Term (1 year)
- Full team collaboration
- Distributed development
- Formal verification integration
- Natural language programming

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Read `PRPs/000-project-bootstrap.md`
3. Set up development environment
4. Start implementing PRPs in order
5. Run validation gates after each PRP

## Questions?

Each PRP contains:

13. **PRP-231**: Claude Code CLI (2-3 hours)

### Phase 5: Quality & CLI (Week 5)
14. **PRP-223**: CLI Commands (2-3 hours)
15. **PRP-224**: Error Handling (3-4 hours)
16. **PRP-225**: Test Generation (3-4 hours)

## Total Estimated Time
- **Phase 1**: 12-15 hours
- **Phase 2**: 11-14 hours (added OpenRouter)
- **Phase 3**: 8-11 hours
- **Phase 4**: 8-11 hours
- **Phase 5**: 8-11 hours
- **Total**: 47-62 hours

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. **Multi-Provider Strategy**
```toml
[llm.orchestration]
primary_gateway = "openrouter"  # Access to 400+ models
fallback_providers = ["claude", "gpt-4", "groq", "ollama"]
consensus = "quality_weighted"
parallel_queries = true
vary_parameters = true
```

### 2. **Quality Through Diversity**
- Same prompt → Multiple providers
- Same provider → Different temperatures
- Multiple attempts → Best selection
- Consensus scoring → Quality assurance

### 3. **Cost Optimization**
- Local models (Ollama) for development
- Groq for fast iteration
- Claude/GPT-4 for complex tasks
- Perplexity for research
- Consensus only when quality critical

## Dependencies to Add

```toml
# LLM Providers
async-openai = "0.24"
anthropic-sdk = "0.2"
ollama-rs = { git = "https://github.com/pepperoni21/ollama-rs.git" }
openrouter-rs = "0.2"  # Gateway to 400+ models
genai = "0.4.0-alpha.4"  # Optional: unified interface

# Code Generation
tera = "1.20"

# Already in project
thiserror = "*"
anyhow = "*"
tokio = "*"
tiktoken-rs = "*"
```

## Success Metrics
- **Response Quality**: 50% improvement through consensus
- **Provider Coverage**: 400+ models via OpenRouter + direct providers
- **Local Capability**: Full offline operation
- **Performance**: <2s for simple generation
- **Reliability**: Automatic failover via OpenRouter
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatic cheapest model selection

## Risk Mitigation
- **Provider Failures**: Fallback chains implemented
- **API Costs**: Local models as primary
- **Response Quality**: Multi-provider consensus
- **Latency**: Parallel execution with timeouts
- **Complexity**: Gradual rollout, feature flags

## Unique Advantages Post-Implementation

1. **Best-in-Class Response Quality**: Multi-provider consensus ensures highest quality code generation
2. **Provider Agnostic**: Not locked to any single AI provider
3. **Cost Flexible**: Mix expensive/cheap providers based on task
4. **Privacy Option**: Full local operation with Ollama
5. **Speed Option**: Groq for 10x faster responses
6. **Research Capable**: Perplexity for real-time information

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize PRPs
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin with PRP-216 (foundation)
4. Implement PRP-227 early (game-changer)
5. Test multi-provider scenarios

## Conclusion
These PRPs transform auto-dev-rs from a basic LLM integration into a sophisticated multi-provider orchestration system. The combination of OpenRouter's universal gateway (400+ models) with the consensus mechanism (PRP-227) addresses both access and quality challenges. OpenRouter provides instant access to every major model with automatic failover, while the consensus system ensures the highest quality output by comparing responses across providers and parameters.
