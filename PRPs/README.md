## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Integration (Current Priority)
1. **CLI Integration**: Connect completed modules to CLI commands
   - ‚úÖ bootstrap command for PRP-209 (COMPLETE)
   - self-monitor command for PRP-201
   - self-dev command for PRP-215
   - self-test command for PRP-208
2. **Complete Partial PRPs**:
   - Finish capability model for PRP-207
   - Centralize metrics for PRP-211
   - Complete integration for PRP-215

### Phase 2: Essential Components
1. **PRP-210**: Version Control Integration - Track self-modifications
2. **PRP-214**: Self-Documentation - Maintain up-to-date docs

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **PRP-213**: Module Marketplace - Share and discover modules
2. Additional enhancements as needed

## Key Insights

### Achievements
- **71.4% Complete**: 20 of 28 PRPs fully implemented and archived
- **Strong Foundation**: All core infrastructure complete
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Module system, hot-reload, and safety gates operational
- **Recent Progress**: Self-test framework just completed

### Current Gaps
- **Integration**: Many modules lack CLI accessibility
- **Bootstrap**: No initialization sequence for self-development
- **Version Control**: Cannot track own changes programmatically
- **Documentation**: No automatic doc generation

### Architecture Notes
- Implementation often deviates from plans but achieves goals effectively
- Modular design allows independent component development
- Safety-first approach evident in completed components

## Recent Updates

- 2025-09-27: Implemented bootstrap sequence (PRP-209) with all stages and commands
- 2025-09-27: Moved completed PRPs (201, 205, 206, 209) to archive
- 2025-09-27: Updated all active PRPs with current implementation status
- 2025-09-27: Reorganized dashboard to separate active/archived PRPs
- 2025-09-27: Implemented self-test framework (PRP-208)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Wire up CLI commands for completed modules
2. **Short-term**: Implement bootstrap sequence for safe initialization
3. **Medium-term**: Add version control integration for change tracking
4. **Long-term**: Complete remaining PRPs based on priority and dependencies
