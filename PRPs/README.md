# Auto-Dev RS - Project Requirements and Planning (PRPs)

## Overview
This directory contains detailed Project Requirements and Planning documents for implementing the auto-dev-rs system. Each PRP is designed to be implemented in 2-4 hours and provides comprehensive context, requirements, and validation criteria.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 0: Bootstrap (Day 1)
1. **000-project-bootstrap.md** - Project setup and workspace configuration

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
2. **001-cli-foundation.md** - CLI structure with clap
3. **002-error-handling.md** - Error handling and result types
4. **003-configuration-system.md** - Configuration with multi-platform support

### Phase 2: Core Systems (Week 1-2)
5. **004-task-tracking-system.md** - Filesystem-based task tracking and memory
6. **005-system-prompts-management.md** - Prompts and procedures management
7. **008-project-detection.md** - Project structure detection

### Phase 3: Plugin Architecture (Week 2)
8. **006-plugin-traits.md** - Plugin trait definitions
9. **007-plugin-discovery.md** - Plugin discovery and loading

### Phase 4: Template System (Week 3)
10. **009-template-engine.md** - Handlebars template engine integration
11. **011-default-templates.md** - Default templates and prompts

### Phase 5: Code Generation (Week 3-4)
12. **010-code-generation-rust.md** - Rust code generation

### Phase 6: Testing (Week 4)
13. **012-integration-tests.md** - Integration testing framework

## Key Features Implemented

### User Requirements Addressed
- ✅ Filesystem-based memory and task tracking with automatic save/load
- ✅ User-configurable filesystem-based prompts and procedures
- ✅ Rich set of default templates and prompts
- ✅ Support for .cursor/*, .claude/*, and other platform configurations
- ✅ No SQL dependencies - everything is filesystem-based

### Technical Architecture
- **CLI Framework**: Clap with derive API for type-safe command parsing
- **Error Handling**: thiserror + anyhow for robust error management
- **Configuration**: Layered config with TOML/JSON support
- **Storage**: JSON-based filesystem persistence (no databases)
- **Templates**: Handlebars for flexible code generation
- **Plugins**: Trait-based system with dynamic loading support

## Development Workflow

### For Each PRP:
1. Read the PRP thoroughly
2. Implement according to the blueprint
3. Run validation gates
4. Ensure all success criteria are met
5. Mark the PRP as complete

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each module
- Integration tests for workflows
- CLI command testing with assert_cmd
- Snapshot testing for generated code

## Confidence Scores
- Average confidence: 8.5/10
- Highest confidence: CLI, Templates, Testing (9/10)
- Lowest confidence: Plugin FFI boundaries (7/10)

## Next Steps After PRPs

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement PRPs 1-3 to establish foundation
2. Create initial release with basic functionality
3. Gather user feedback

### Future Enhancements
- Additional language support (Python, JavaScript)
- Cloud integration features
- AI-powered code suggestions
- Plugin marketplace
- Remote collaboration features

## Resources

### Documentation
- Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Clap Documentation: https://docs.rs/clap/
- Handlebars Guide: https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/

### Tools Required
- Rust 2024 edition
- Cargo with workspace support
- Git for version control

## Contributing
Each PRP is self-contained and can be implemented independently by different developers. Ensure you follow the validation gates and success criteria defined in each PRP.

## Questions or Clarifications
If any PRP needs clarification or you encounter blockers:
1. Check if other PRPs provide context
2. Review the research references
3. Consider the user requirements stated above
4. Ask for clarification before proceeding
