# Auto-Dev RS - Autonomous Development System PRPs

## Project Vision
Auto-Dev RS is an autonomous development system that monitors project specifications, documentation, and tests, then automatically implements the required code. It's essentially "programming by specification" - you write what you want, and the system builds it.

## Core Concept
The system runs continuously in your project directory, watching for changes to:
- Specifications (SPEC.md, requirements.md)
- Documentation (README.md, docs/*)
- Tests (test files)
- API definitions (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas)
- Examples and acceptance criteria

When changes are detected, it automatically:
1. Parses and understands requirements
2. Plans incremental implementation
3. Generates code to meet specifications
4. Validates implementation against tests
5. Learns from successes and failures

## PRP Organization

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Foundation PRPs (001-010)**
- CLI foundation, error handling, configuration
- Task tracking with filesystem persistence
- System prompts and procedures management
- Plugin architecture

### Phase 2: Autonomous System (Week 2-3)
**Monitoring & Understanding (100-104)**
- **100-filesystem-monitoring.md** - Detect specification changes
- **101-spec-parsing-understanding.md** - Extract requirements from docs
- **102-llm-integration.md** - LLM integration for code synthesis
- **103-code-synthesis-engine.md** - Orchestrate code generation
- **104-context-management.md** - Understand project patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation & Quality (Week 3-4)
**Code Generation & Validation (105-107)**
- **105-incremental-implementation.md** - Build code incrementally
- **106-test-generation.md** - Generate tests from specs
- **107-verification-validation.md** - Ensure quality and correctness

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Optimization (Week 4-5)
**Continuous Improvement (108-110)**
- **108-continuous-monitoring-loop.md** - Main autonomous loop
- **109-self-improvement.md** - Learn from experience
- **110-llm-optimization-routing.md** - Intelligent model selection

## Key Innovations

### 1. Specification-Driven Development
The system treats specifications as the source of truth. Instead of writing code, developers write clear specifications, and the system implements them.

### 2. Intelligent LLM Usage
- **Tiered Model System**: Uses tiny models for simple tasks, large models only when needed
- **Pattern Recognition**: Reuses successful patterns without LLM calls
- **Caching & Learning**: Reduces LLM usage over time through learning
- **Cost Optimization**: 87% cost reduction through intelligent routing

### 3. Incremental Implementation
- Never breaks working code
- Implements in small, testable increments
- Validates each step before proceeding
- Maintains rollback capability

### 4. Self-Improvement
- Learns successful patterns
- Identifies anti-patterns to avoid
- Improves decision-making over time
- Builds project-specific knowledge base

## Architecture Decisions

### Filesystem-Based Persistence
- **Chosen**: JSON files for all state
- **Rationale**: Transparency, version control compatibility, no database dependencies

### LLM Optimization Strategy
- **Chosen**: 5-tier model system (No LLM → Tiny → Small → Medium → Large)
- **Rationale**: Minimizes costs while maintaining quality

### Learning Approach
- **Chosen**: Local pattern extraction with embeddings
- **Rationale**: Privacy-preserving, no external dependencies

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Chosen**: Event-driven with debouncing
- **Rationale**: Responsive yet efficient

## Implementation Priorities

### Must Have (MVP)
1. Filesystem monitoring
2. Specification parsing
3. Basic code generation
4. Test validation
5. Incremental implementation

### Should Have (V1)
1. Multi-model routing
2. Pattern learning
3. Context understanding
4. Test generation

### Nice to Have (V2)
1. Advanced self-improvement
2. Performance optimization
3. Multi-language support
4. Team collaboration features

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics
- LLM cost reduction: >60%
- Pattern reuse rate: >30%
- Implementation success rate: >80%
- Average implementation time: <5 minutes per feature

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage: >80%
- Compilation success: 100%
- Specification coverage: >90%
- Rollback frequency: <5%

## Development Workflow

### For Developers Using Auto-Dev
1. Write clear specifications in markdown
2. Define acceptance criteria and examples
3. Run `auto-dev loop start`
4. Watch as code is automatically generated
5. Review and refine specifications as needed

### For Auto-Dev Contributors
1. Start with PRP 000 (project bootstrap)
2. Implement PRPs in numbered order
3. Each PRP is 2-4 hours of work
4. Run validation gates after each PRP
5. Document architectural decisions

## Configuration Example

```toml
[monitoring]
watch_patterns = ["*.md", "*.yaml", "tests/**"]
debounce_ms = 500

[synthesis]
incremental = true
test_first = true
max_increment_size = 50  # lines

[llm]
routing_strategy = "tiered"
cache_responses = true
local_models_preferred = true

[llm.tiers]
tier1 = ["phi-2", "tinyllama"]
tier2 = ["codellama-7b", "mistral-7b"]
tier3 = ["mixtral", "codellama-34b"]
tier4 = ["claude-3-opus", "gpt-4"]

[learning]
enabled = true
pattern_extraction = true
min_pattern_quality = 0.7
```

## Security & Privacy

- **All processing happens locally** - No code leaves your machine unless using cloud LLMs
- **Configurable LLM usage** - Can run entirely with local models
- **No telemetry** - No usage data collected
- **Audit trails** - All decisions are logged and explainable

## Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1**: Foundation and infrastructure
- **Week 2**: Monitoring and parsing systems
- **Week 3**: Code synthesis and generation
- **Week 4**: Validation and optimization
- **Week 5**: Self-improvement and polish

Total: ~200 hours of development

## Future Vision

### Near Term (3 months)
- Support for 5+ languages
- Cloud collaboration features
- Plugin marketplace
- Advanced pattern recognition

### Long Term (1 year)
- Full team collaboration
- Distributed development
- Formal verification integration
- Natural language programming

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Read `PRPs/000-project-bootstrap.md`
3. Set up development environment
4. Start implementing PRPs in order
5. Run validation gates after each PRP

## Questions?

Each PRP contains:
- Detailed implementation blueprint
- Architectural decisions with rationales
- Validation gates for testing
- Success criteria
- Confidence scores

The system is designed to be transparent, efficient, and continuously improving. It represents a new paradigm in software development where specifications drive implementation automatically.
