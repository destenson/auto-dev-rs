# PRP: Self-Development Integration and Orchestration

## Overview
Integrate all self-development components into a cohesive system that enables auto-dev-rs to autonomously improve itself while maintaining stability, safety, and continuous operation.

## Context and Background
This PRP ties together all the self-development capabilities (PRPs 200-214) into a unified system. It defines how these components work together to achieve true self-hosting where auto-dev-rs can develop, test, and deploy improvements to itself.

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Orchestrate all self-development components
2. Ensure safe autonomous operation
3. Maintain system stability
4. Enable continuous improvement
5. Provide monitoring and control

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing architecture
- Cannot compromise safety
- Should be controllable by operators
- Must be observable
- Should support gradual enablement

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Integration Architecture
**Chosen**: Event-driven orchestration with state machine
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic controller: Too rigid
- Microservices: Too complex
- Pipeline only: Lacks flexibility
**Rationale**: Event-driven provides flexibility with clear state management

### Decision: Enablement Strategy
**Chosen**: Progressive feature flags
**Alternatives Considered**:
- All-or-nothing: Too risky
- Time-based rollout: Not control-based
- Random activation: Unpredictable
**Rationale**: Feature flags allow controlled, reversible enablement

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Structure
Create orchestration in auto-dev-core/src/self_dev/
- mod.rs - Self-development interface
- orchestrator.rs - Main orchestration
- state_machine.rs - Development state management
- coordinator.rs - Component coordination
- monitor.rs - Self-dev monitoring
- control.rs - Operator controls

### Key Components
1. **SelfDevOrchestrator** - Central coordinator
2. **DevelopmentStateMachine** - Manages dev states
3. **ComponentCoordinator** - Integrates components
4. **SafetyMonitor** - Ensures safe operation
5. **OperatorInterface** - Human control interface

### Implementation Tasks (in order)
1. Create orchestrator framework
2. Define state machine for self-dev
3. Integrate safety validation gates
4. Connect module system
5. Wire up hot-reload infrastructure
6. Integrate version control
7. Connect testing framework
8. Link metrics collection
9. Add operator controls
10. Implement progressive enablement

## Self-Development Flow

### Complete Cycle
1. **Monitor** - Watch for TODOs, issues, specs
2. **Analyze** - Understand requirements
3. **Plan** - Create implementation plan
4. **Generate** - Create solution
5. **Test** - Validate in sandbox
6. **Review** - Safety gates check
7. **Deploy** - Hot-reload or upgrade
8. **Verify** - Confirm improvement
9. **Document** - Update docs
10. **Learn** - Extract patterns

### State Machine States
- **Idle** - Waiting for triggers
- **Analyzing** - Understanding requirements
- **Planning** - Creating approach
- **Developing** - Generating code
- **Testing** - Validating changes
- **Reviewing** - Safety checks
- **Deploying** - Applying changes
- **Monitoring** - Watching effects
- **Learning** - Improving patterns

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Start self-development mode
cargo run -- self-dev start

# Check current state
cargo run -- self-dev status

# Pause self-development
cargo run -- self-dev pause

# Review pending changes
cargo run -- self-dev review

# Emergency stop
cargo run -- self-dev emergency-stop
```

## Success Criteria
- Successfully self-improves daily
- Zero critical failures
- Maintains 99.9% uptime
- Improvements measurable
- Fully auditable operation

## Component Integration Map

### Data Flow
```
Monitoring → Specification → Synthesis → Testing
    ↓            ↓             ↓          ↓
Metrics ← Documentation ← Deployment ← Validation
```

### Component Dependencies
- Bootstrap → All components
- Safety Gates → All modifications
- Module System → Hot reload
- Version Control → All changes
- Metrics → Learning system

## Known Patterns and Conventions
- Use state machine pattern
- Follow event sourcing for audit
- Match existing CLI structure
- Reuse configuration patterns

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't enable everything at once
- Remember emergency shutdown
- Avoid autonomous mode without monitoring
- Don't skip integration tests
- Consider cascading failures

## Progressive Enablement Plan

### Phase 1: Observation Only
- Enable monitoring
- Collect metrics
- Generate reports
- No modifications

### Phase 2: Assisted Mode
- Generate suggestions
- Require approval
- Manual deployment
- Full rollback capability

### Phase 3: Semi-Autonomous
- Auto-generate safe changes
- Auto-test
- Manual review required
- Auto-document

### Phase 4: Fully Autonomous
- Complete self-development
- Auto-approve safe changes
- Continuous improvement
- Human oversight only

## Configuration
Example self-development configuration:
```toml
[self_dev]
enabled = true
mode = "assisted"
safety_level = "strict"
auto_approve = false
max_changes_per_day = 10
require_tests = true
require_documentation = true

[self_dev.components]
monitoring = true
synthesis = true
testing = true
deployment = false
learning = true
```

## Confidence Score: 7/10
Integration is complex due to many moving parts, but the event-driven architecture with progressive enablement provides a safe path to full self-development capability.
