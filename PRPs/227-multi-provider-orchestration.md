# PRP: Multi-Provider LLM Orchestration and Consensus

**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Priority**: Critical (P1)  
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

## Overview
Implement a multi-provider orchestration system that can query multiple LLMs (with varied parameters) and select the best response through quality scoring and consensus mechanisms.

## Context and Background
LLM responses vary significantly based on provider, model, temperature, and other parameters. Getting multiple opinions and selecting the best (or combining them) dramatically improves output quality. This is especially important for code generation where correctness is critical.

### Research References
- Ensemble learning techniques
- Fabric's multi-provider patterns: https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric
- rust-genai multi-provider: https://github.com/jeremychone/rust-genai
- Quality scoring research papers

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Query multiple providers in parallel
2. Vary parameters (temperature, top-p) across queries
3. Implement quality scoring for responses
4. Create consensus/selection mechanisms
5. Support fallback chains

### Technical Constraints
- Must not increase latency significantly
- Should track costs across providers
- Must handle partial failures
- Should cache consensus results

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Execution Model
**Chosen**: Parallel with timeout
**Rationale**: Minimizes latency while gathering multiple opinions

### Decision: Selection Strategy
**Chosen**: Pluggable scoring with defaults
**Rationale**: Different tasks need different quality metrics

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Structure
Create in `auto-dev-core/src/llm/`:
- Create `orchestrator.rs` - Main orchestration logic
- Create `consensus.rs` - Response selection
- Create `quality_scorer.rs` - Response quality metrics
- Create `provider_pool.rs` - Provider management

### Key Components
1. **LLMOrchestrator** - Coordinates multiple providers
2. **ConsensusEngine** - Selects best response
3. **QualityScorer** - Scores response quality
4. **ProviderPool** - Manages provider instances
5. **ParameterVariator** - Varies temperature/top-p

### Implementation Tasks (in order)
1. Create ProviderPool to manage instances
2. Implement parallel query execution
3. Create quality scoring metrics
4. Build consensus selection logic
5. Add parameter variation strategy
6. Implement result caching
7. Add cost tracking
8. Create comprehensive tests

## Query Strategies

### Variation Patterns
- **Same prompt, different providers**: Claude, GPT-4, Llama
- **Same provider, different parameters**: temp 0.2, 0.5, 0.8
- **Different models**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, varied sizes
- **Multiple attempts**: Same everything, N times

### Quality Metrics
- **Syntax validity**: Does code compile/parse?
- **Completeness**: All requirements addressed?
- **Consistency**: Internal logic coherent?
- **Best practices**: Follows conventions?
- **Performance**: Efficient approach?

## Consensus Mechanisms

1. **Majority Vote**: Most common elements
2. **Quality Weighted**: Highest scored response
3. **Hybrid Merge**: Combine best parts
4. **Tournament**: Pairwise comparisons
5. **Confidence Threshold**: Require minimum agreement

## Configuration Example

```toml
[orchestration]
strategy = "parallel"
timeout_seconds = 30
max_providers = 3

[orchestration.variations]
temperature = [0.2, 0.5, 0.8]
top_p = [0.9, 0.95]
providers = ["claude", "gpt-4", "ollama"]

[orchestration.consensus]
method = "quality_weighted"
min_responses = 2
cache_ttl = 3600
```

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Build and test
cargo build --package auto-dev-core
cargo test --package auto-dev-core --lib llm::orchestrator

# Test parallel execution
cargo test --package auto-dev-core --lib llm::orchestrator::parallel

# Test consensus mechanisms
cargo test --package auto-dev-core --lib llm::consensus

# Integration test with multiple providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=... CLAUDE_API_KEY=... cargo test orchestration -- --ignored

# Format and lint
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

## Success Criteria
- Queries execute in parallel
- Best response selected reliably
- Latency < 1.5x single query
- Cost tracking accurate
- Handles provider failures

## Dependencies Required
- tokio for parallel execution
- dashmap for concurrent caching
- Already have other requirements

## Known Patterns and Conventions
- Use tokio::join! for parallel queries
- Implement timeout with tokio::time::timeout
- Use Arc<dyn LLMProvider> for polymorphism
- Cache with TTL for cost savings

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't wait for slowest provider
- Handle rate limits per provider
- Avoid infinite retries
- Track costs carefully
- Test with provider failures

## Testing Approach
- Unit test each component
- Mock providers with varied responses
- Test timeout behavior
- Test consensus with disagreement
- Benchmark parallel vs sequential

## Cost Optimization
- Cache consensus results
- Skip expensive providers for simple tasks
- Use quality threshold to stop early
- Track cost/quality tradeoff

## Confidence Score: 7/10
Complex orchestration logic but clear requirements. Main challenge in quality scoring and consensus mechanisms.
