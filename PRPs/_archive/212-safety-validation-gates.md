# PRP: Safety Validation Gates

## Overview
Implement comprehensive safety validation gates that prevent auto-dev-rs from making dangerous self-modifications, ensuring system stability during autonomous development.

## Context and Background
Safety gates are critical checkpoints that validate self-modifications before they're applied. These gates prevent auto-dev-rs from breaking itself, corrupting data, or creating security vulnerabilities during self-development.

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Validate modifications before application
2. Detect potentially dangerous changes
3. Enforce invariants and contracts
4. Prevent critical file modifications
5. Ensure reversibility of changes

### Technical Constraints
- Must not be bypassable
- Should complete validation quickly
- Must have zero false negatives for critical issues
- Should minimize false positives
- Must provide clear failure reasons

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Validation Strategy
**Chosen**: Multi-layer defense with fail-safe defaults
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single checkpoint: Single point of failure
- Probabilistic checking: May miss issues
- External validator: Adds dependency
**Rationale**: Multiple layers ensure comprehensive protection

### Decision: Gate Enforcement
**Chosen**: Mandatory compile-time and runtime checks
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Runtime only: May be too late
- Optional gates: Too risky
- Compile-time only: Misses runtime issues
**Rationale**: Combined approach catches issues early and late

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Structure
Create safety system in auto-dev-core/src/safety/
- mod.rs - Safety system interface
- gates.rs - Validation gate definitions
- validators.rs - Validation implementations
- invariants.rs - System invariants
- contracts.rs - Code contracts
- analyzer.rs - Static analysis

### Key Components
1. **SafetyGatekeeper** - Main safety coordinator
2. **ValidationGate** - Individual gate interface
3. **InvariantChecker** - System invariant validation
4. **ContractVerifier** - Contract enforcement
5. **StaticAnalyzer** - Code analysis

### Implementation Tasks (in order)
1. Define safety gate interface
2. Create critical file protection list
3. Implement syntax validation gate
4. Build semantic validation gate
5. Add security validation gate
6. Create performance validation gate
7. Implement reversibility checker
8. Add invariant verification
9. Build contract system
10. Create gate reporting system

## Validation Gate Layers

### Layer 1: Static Analysis
- Syntax correctness
- Type safety
- Borrow checker passes
- No unsafe code in critical paths
- No panics in main flow

### Layer 2: Semantic Validation
- Preserves API contracts
- Maintains backwards compatibility
- No breaking changes to public interface
- Preserves module boundaries
- Maintains error handling

### Layer 3: Security Gates
- No hardcoded credentials
- No network access in core
- No filesystem access outside boundaries
- No arbitrary code execution
- No privilege escalation

### Layer 4: Performance Gates
- No O(nÂ²) or worse algorithms
- Memory usage within bounds
- No infinite loops
- No blocking I/O in async
- No resource leaks

### Layer 5: Reversibility
- All changes can be rolled back
- State can be restored
- No destructive operations
- Backup exists before modification
- Recovery procedure defined

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Run all safety gates
cargo run -- safety validate

# Check specific gate
cargo run -- safety check security

# Validate before modification
cargo run -- safety pre-modify

# Post-modification validation
cargo run -- safety post-modify
```

## Success Criteria
- Catches 100% of critical issues
- <5% false positive rate
- Validation completes in <30 seconds
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Cannot be accidentally bypassed

## Known Patterns and Conventions
- Follow fail-safe defaults principle
- Use defense in depth pattern
- Match existing error types
- Reuse validation traits from std

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't allow gate bypass "for testing"
- Remember to validate generated code
- Avoid validation that's too strict
- Don't forget about race conditions
- Consider time-of-check vs time-of-use

## Critical Files and Paths
Never allow modification of:
- /src/main.rs (entry point)
- /src/safety/* (safety system itself)
- /Cargo.lock (during execution)
- /.git/* (version control)
- System files outside project

## Gate Configuration
Example safety gates configuration:
- gates.static_analysis = true
- gates.semantic = true
- gates.security = true
- gates.performance = true
- gates.reversibility = true
- gates.fail_fast = true
- gates.require_all = true

## Confidence Score: 9/10
Safety validation is critical and well-understood. The multi-layer approach with clear gates provides strong protection. Main challenge is balancing safety with flexibility.
