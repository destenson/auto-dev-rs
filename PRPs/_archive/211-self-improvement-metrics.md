# PRP: Self-Improvement Metrics and Monitoring

**Status**: COMPLETE (2025-09-27) - Full metrics module implemented with collection, storage, analysis, and dashboard

## Overview
Implement comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring for auto-dev-rs's self-development activities, enabling the system to measure its own improvement and make data-driven decisions about future modifications.

## Context and Background
To truly achieve continuous self-improvement, auto-dev-rs needs to measure the impact of its self-modifications. This system tracks metrics about code quality, performance, capability expansion, and development velocity.

### Research References
- Software metrics: https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis
- Prometheus metrics: https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/
- DORA metrics: https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics/
- Code quality metrics: https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/issues

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Track self-development velocity
2. Measure code quality improvements
3. Monitor performance changes
4. Track capability additions
5. Measure success/failure rates

### Technical Constraints
- Must have minimal performance impact
- Should persist metrics across restarts
- Must support time-series analysis
- Should enable trend detection
- Must export metrics for analysis

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Metrics Storage
**Chosen**: Time-series file-based with rotation
**Alternatives Considered**:
- In-memory only: Loses history
- External database: Adds dependency
- Cloud metrics: Privacy concerns
**Rationale**: File-based provides persistence without dependencies

### Decision: Collection Strategy
**Chosen**: Event-driven with aggregation
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Polling: Misses events
- Continuous: Too much overhead
- Sampling: Incomplete picture
**Rationale**: Events capture all changes with efficient aggregation

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Structure
Create metrics system in auto-dev-core/src/metrics/
- mod.rs - Metrics interface
- collector.rs - Metric collection
- storage.rs - Time-series storage
- analyzer.rs - Trend analysis
- exporter.rs - Export formats
- dashboard.rs - Metric visualization

### Key Components
1. **MetricsCollector** - Gathers metrics
2. **TimeSeriesStore** - Stores metrics
3. **TrendAnalyzer** - Analyzes trends
4. **MetricsExporter** - Exports data
5. **ImprovementTracker** - Tracks progress

### Implementation Tasks (in order)
1. Define metric types and schema
2. Create metrics collection interface
3. Implement time-series storage
4. Build event collection system
5. Add metric aggregation
6. Create trend analysis algorithms
7. Implement metrics export
8. Build CLI dashboard
9. Add alerting for regressions
10. Create improvement reports

## Key Metrics to Track

### Development Metrics
- Modifications per day
- Success rate of modifications
- Time to implement features
- Rollback frequency
- Test coverage changes

### Quality Metrics
- Code complexity (cyclomatic)
- Documentation coverage
- Lint warnings/errors
- Duplicate code percentage
- Technical debt score

### Performance Metrics
- Compilation time
- Test execution time
- Binary size
- Memory usage
- Module load time

### Capability Metrics
- Features added
- APIs created
- Modules loaded
- Patterns learned
- LLM calls saved

## Validation Gates

```bash
# View metrics dashboard
cargo run -- metrics dashboard

# Export metrics
cargo run -- metrics export --format json

# Analyze trends
cargo run -- metrics trends --days 30

# Check improvement score
cargo run -- metrics score
```

## Success Criteria
- Captures all self-modification events
- Detects trends within 5 events
- Dashboard updates in real-time
- Export supports multiple formats
- Overhead <1% CPU/memory

## Known Patterns and Conventions
- Follow Prometheus metric naming
- Use StatsD-style aggregation
- Match existing logging patterns
- Reuse serialization from state module

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't collect sensitive information
- Remember to rotate old metrics
- Avoid high-cardinality labels
- Don't block on metric collection
- Consider metric storage growth

## Dependencies Required
- Already available: serde, chrono
- Optional: plotters for visualization
- Optional: statrs for statistics

## Metric Schemas

## Confidence Score: 7/10
Metrics collection is straightforward, but meaningful trend analysis and actionable insights require careful design. The main challenge is selecting metrics that truly indicate improvement.
