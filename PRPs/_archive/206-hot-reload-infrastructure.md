# PRP: Hot-Reload Infrastructure

**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-09-27) - Complete 8-phase reload system with rollback

## Overview
Build the infrastructure to support hot-reloading of modules without losing state or interrupting operations, enabling seamless updates during self-development.

## Context and Background
Hot-reloading allows auto-dev-rs to update its functionality while running, crucial for continuous self-improvement. This infrastructure manages the complexity of swapping code while preserving state and handling in-flight operations.

- Graceful reloading: https://github.com/cloudflare/tableflip
- Zero-downtime deployments: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Reload modules without dropping requests
2. Preserve module state across reloads
3. Handle in-flight operations gracefully
4. Provide atomic reload transactions
5. Support rollback on failure

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain type safety across reloads
- Cannot lose messages during reload
- Must handle version incompatibilities
- Should minimize reload time
- Must support concurrent module reloads

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: State Management Strategy
**Chosen**: Versioned state snapshots with migration
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Stateless only: Too limiting
- Shared memory persistence: Complex synchronization
- External state store: Adds dependency
**Rationale**: Snapshots provide clean transitions with migration path

### Decision: Reload Coordination
**Chosen**: Staged reload with traffic draining
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Immediate swap: May lose operations
- Blue-green modules: Too much memory
- Queue everything: High latency
**Rationale**: Staged approach balances safety with performance

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Structure
Extend modules system in auto-dev-core/src/modules/hot_reload/
- mod.rs - Hot reload exports
- coordinator.rs - Reload orchestration
- state_manager.rs - State snapshot/restore
- traffic_controller.rs - Request routing during reload
- migration.rs - State version migration
- verifier.rs - Post-reload verification

### Key Components
1. **ReloadCoordinator** - Orchestrates reload process
2. **StateManager** - Handles state preservation
3. **TrafficController** - Routes requests during reload
4. **MigrationEngine** - Migrates state between versions
5. **ReloadVerifier** - Validates successful reload

### Implementation Tasks (in order)
1. Create reload coordinator with phases
2. Implement state snapshotting mechanism
3. Build traffic controller with draining
4. Add state versioning system
5. Create migration engine for state upgrades
6. Implement atomic reload transactions
7. Add rollback triggers and mechanism
8. Build verification tests
9. Create reload metrics collection
10. Add reload scheduling system

## Reload Process Phases
1. **Prepare** - Load new module version
2. **Drain** - Stop new requests to old module
3. **Snapshot** - Capture current state
4. **Migrate** - Transform state if needed
5. **Swap** - Replace old with new module
6. **Restore** - Load state into new module
7. **Verify** - Ensure module works
8. **Commit** or **Rollback** based on verification

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Test basic hot reload
cargo test modules::hot_reload

# Test state preservation
cargo run -- modules test-stateful-reload

# Test concurrent reloads
cargo run -- modules test-concurrent-reload

# Benchmark reload time
cargo bench hot_reload::performance
```

## Success Criteria
- Zero message loss during reload
- State fully preserved or migrated
- Reload completes in <100ms
- Concurrent reloads don't interfere
- Automatic rollback on failure

## Known Patterns and Conventions
- Use two-phase commit for atomicity
- Follow actor model's become pattern
- Reuse state serialization from synthesis module
- Match transaction patterns from database systems

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't assume state format compatibility
- Remember to handle timeout during drain
- Avoid blocking operations during swap
- Don't forget to update routing tables
- Consider memory usage during transition

## Dependencies Required
- Already available: serde, bincode
- Consider adding: crossbeam-channel for coordination

## State Migration Example
State migration should handle:
- Field additions/removals
- Type changes
- Structural reorganization
- Default value population
- Validation of migrated state

## Confidence Score: 6/10
Hot-reloading with state preservation is complex, especially handling all edge cases. The staged approach reduces risk but requires careful coordination.
