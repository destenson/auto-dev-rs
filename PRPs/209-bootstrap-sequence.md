# PRP: Self-Development Bootstrap Sequence

## Overview
Implement the bootstrap sequence that initializes auto-dev-rs's self-development mode, setting up the environment, validating prerequisites, and starting the continuous self-improvement loop.

## Context and Background
The bootstrap process is critical for safely entering self-development mode. It ensures all safety mechanisms are in place, validates the environment, and establishes the initial conditions for autonomous self-improvement.

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Validate environment readiness
2. Initialize safety mechanisms
3. Create baseline snapshots
4. Start monitoring own codebase
5. Begin continuous improvement loop

### Technical Constraints
- Must be idempotent
- Cannot proceed if safety checks fail
- Should be resumable after interruption
- Must create audit trail
- Should support dry-run mode

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Bootstrap Stages
**Chosen**: Multi-stage with checkpoints
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single atomic operation: Too risky
- Manual step-by-step: Error-prone
- Automated no-check: Dangerous
**Rationale**: Stages allow validation and recovery at each step

### Decision: Safety Validation
**Chosen**: Mandatory pre-flight checks
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Optional checks: Too dangerous
- Runtime checks only: May be too late
- External validator: Adds dependency
**Rationale**: Pre-flight ensures safe environment before starting

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Structure
Create bootstrap system in auto-dev-core/src/bootstrap/
- mod.rs - Bootstrap interface
- sequence.rs - Bootstrap orchestration
- validator.rs - Environment validation
- initializer.rs - System initialization
- snapshot.rs - Baseline creation
- preflight.rs - Pre-flight checks

### Key Components
1. **BootstrapSequence** - Main orchestrator
2. **PreflightChecker** - Validates environment
3. **SystemInitializer** - Sets up components
4. **BaselineCreator** - Creates snapshots
5. **LoopStarter** - Begins self-development

### Implementation Tasks (in order)
1. Create bootstrap command structure
2. Implement pre-flight validation checks
3. Build environment preparation
4. Create baseline snapshot system
5. Implement safety mechanism initialization
6. Add module system startup
7. Create monitoring activation
8. Build improvement loop starter
9. Add checkpoint/resume capability
10. Implement bootstrap status reporting

## Bootstrap Stages

### Stage 1: Pre-flight Checks
- Verify Rust toolchain available
- Check disk space (>1GB free)
- Validate git repository state
- Ensure no uncommitted changes
- Verify test suite passes
- Check configuration validity

### Stage 2: Environment Setup
- Create working directories
- Initialize module system
- Set up sandbox environment
- Configure monitoring paths
- Establish safety boundaries
- Load existing modules

### Stage 3: Baseline Creation
- Snapshot current binary
- Record current performance
- Document current capabilities
- Save configuration state
- Create rollback point
- Generate initial metrics

### Stage 4: Activation
- Start self-monitoring
- Enable specification generation
- Activate synthesis engine
- Begin continuous loop
- Start metric collection
- Enable hot-reload system

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Run bootstrap pre-flight
cargo run -- bootstrap preflight

# Dry-run bootstrap
cargo run -- bootstrap --dry-run

# Full bootstrap
cargo run -- bootstrap start

# Check bootstrap status
cargo run -- bootstrap status

# Resume interrupted bootstrap
cargo run -- bootstrap resume
```

## Success Criteria
- All pre-flight checks pass
- Environment properly configured
- Baseline successfully created
- Monitoring activated
- Loop started successfully
- Can resume from any stage

## Known Patterns and Conventions
- Use builder pattern for configuration
- Follow command pattern for stages
- Reuse existing CLI structure
- Match initialization patterns from main.rs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't skip pre-flight checks
- Remember to handle Ctrl+C gracefully
- Avoid partial initialization
- Don't forget to log all steps
- Consider permission issues

## Bootstrap Configuration
Example .auto-dev/bootstrap.toml:
- preflight.strict = true
- baseline.include_performance = true
- safety.require_clean_git = true
- modules.load_existing = true
- monitoring.start_immediately = false
- loop.initial_delay_seconds = 10

## Recovery Procedures
If bootstrap fails:
1. Check logs at .auto-dev/bootstrap.log
2. Run `bootstrap status` to see failed stage
3. Fix identified issues
4. Run `bootstrap resume` to continue
5. Or run `bootstrap reset` to start over

## Confidence Score: 9/10
Bootstrap sequence is well-defined with clear stages and validation. Main complexity is in coordinating all components, but staged approach makes this manageable.
